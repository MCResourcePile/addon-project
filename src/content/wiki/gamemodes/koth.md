#### Description

King of the hill, or KOTH is a gamemode which you have to capture and hold hills in order to win the game. Hills can generate points once captured, thus many KOTH maps allow wins once a team has hit a point limit. There is no limit to how many hills there can be on a map.

#### Variants of King of the Hill

### Capture Points

Traditionally, this variant has 5 hills, which are all required to be captured to win the game. In these type of games, the 5 hills are strung out in a line, with each team already holding the two hills closest to their sides. It is required to capture the preceding hill before capturing other hills. Capturing a new hill generally decreases the amount of time it takes to get back to the middle, thus making it easier to capture new hills. Alternatively, there are some maps which don't have 5 hills, nor any hills already claimed by a team. These maps are won when all hills are captured.
