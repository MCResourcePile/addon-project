### Capture The Wool

Capture the wool, or CTW, as it is commonly known, is one of the many gamemodes that can be played on the PGM plugin.  The game of Capture the Wool is probably by far the most popular gamemode across OCN and stratus.The goal of the match is to steal the wool, whether it be from crafting, killing, or capturing it, from the enemy team, and take it back to your side.  You can think of it as a modified Capture the Flag game.  On a typical map, the wool will be stored in a wool room, of which more will be said later.  A match will end when one team has captured each wool they need to win.

#### Wool Rooms

The Wool Room is where the wool is stored.  Almost every CTW map has one per wool, with the exception of [Cloud Nine](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/maps/overcast?s=cloud_nine) and [Dead Heat](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/maps/overcast?s=dead_heat).  Several other less known maps follow the style of play of those maps.  Inside the wool room is gear to help a capturer return to their own teams side.  This can involve speed potions, health potions, extra blocks, punch/power bows, diamond armor, enchanted iron armor, or golden apples.  Most of the time, the gear is stored in chests in the wool room.  on the map Tetrad, the gear is applied automatically.  The wool will be spawned, force applieid in a kit, or located inside of chests for you to grab.  Running out fo the wool room is a whole different story.

#### Wool Monument

The Wool Monument may sound like a [DTM objective](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/addon-project/wiki/gamemodes/dtm), but it is not.  THis is the location that the wool must be placed in order to come closer to winning the game, or, win the game.  Traditionally, the wool monument is a bedrock structure located near or inside of the spawn.  One or more indicators will be present of which wool to place where, whether it be by sign or dyed blocks behind it such as wool, stained glass, or clay.  Getting back to the wool monument in early game will usually consist of running across a thin bridge, in later game across a skybridge, and in mid game one or the other, or a mix of both.

#### Trivia
  * Maps can be 4-team-CTW, such as Tetrad, Battle Ecliptica, or Curly Woods.
  * Zeta is a map in which you spawn with the wool and must carry it to the other teams side. (Not confirmed)
  * In Ender Blast and Chimeric you must first destroy a monument in order to capture the wool.
  * In Cloud Nine, you get string from killing enemies and dye is spawned around the map; you must craft the wool.
  * Dead Heat is a Blitz map in which the wool is located at the center of the map and you can kill all the enemies, or place the wool.
