#####Capture The Wool

Capture the wool, or ctw, as it is commonly known, is one of the many gamemodes that can be played on the PGM plugin.  The game of Capture the Wool is probably by far the most popular gamemode across OCN and stratus.The goal of the match is to steal the wool, whether it be from crafting, killing, or capturing it, from the enemy team, and take it back to your side.  You can think of it as a modified Capture the Flag game.  On a typical map, the wool will be stored in a wool room, of which more will be said later.  A match will end when one team has captured each wool they need to win.
