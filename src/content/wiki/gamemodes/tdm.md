#### Description 

Team Deathmatch, or more commonly known as TDM is a PGM gamemode with the objective to kill as many players from the opposing team before time runs out. Killing a player results in a point gained for your team, and as such the winning team will have more points at the end of the game. Traditionally, TDM maps only had two teams, yet there are a few maps with more than two teams.

#### Variants of Team Deathmatch

##### Scorebox

In this variant there are specified regions which will reward a player with points when they enter. Scoreboxes are usually found at the very end of the enemy's side, and so a player will have to maneuver and fight their way to each a scorebox. Points are still rewarded for each kill, but scoreboxes will reward a greater amount of points. This means that killing the most players doesn't necessarily guarantee a victory.

##### Rage

This variant is very similar to the normal TDM, with the exception that players die instantly upon being hit, either by melee or arrow.

#### Trivia

- It is possible to play a map with both the Rage and Scroebox variant
- In many TDM maps, there are special items hidden in chest across the map
- FFA maps can often be confused with TDM maps. It's important to remember their difference; TDM is played in teams while FFA is played solo
