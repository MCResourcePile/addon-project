#### Mutations

Mutations are a PGM feature which may be used to modify elements of a single match. Some examples of mutations are the Armor mutation, which gives players diamond armor, and the Health mutation, which gives players 10 extra hearts of health. Mutations only last for a single match, and may be enabled or disabled by staff members. Mutations can also be enabled through the use of a Mutation Token, which will create a poll for players to vote and decide whether or not to add a specific Mutation.

#### List of Mutations

Below are a full list of mutations currently usable on Stratus.

#### Kit-based mutations

This section lists mutations which are granted through kits.

- Armor
    - Full diamond armor and a diamond sword. Pack a punch!
- Boat
    - Gives players a boat that can float anywhere. Only works with 1.9+ versions.
- Bread
    - A meme come to life. This mutation grants players various breads. It, however, knows and punishes players for switching teams.
- Elytra
    - Spawns with an Elytra in the players chestplate slot. Includes a modified version of the Jump mutation that propels players higher but takes much longer to recharge.
- Enchantment
    - Applies different enchants to almost everything in your inventory, including tools, armor, weapons and bows. These enchantments are applied with different levels of enchantment.
- Equestrian
    - Grants players the ability to traverse the map on their own horse! Players are given a spawn egg for their own horse, and each horse spawns with randomly provisioned armor.
- Explosive
    - Gives players a kit with 8 TNT and flint and steel. During this mutation, TNT explosions have a randomised radius.
- Health
    - Doubles health from 10 to 20 hearts. Each kill rewards players a golden apple.
- Mobs
    - Gives players spawn eggs to spawn random mobs.
- Potion
    - Spawns players with various potions to use on their victims or on their teammates, with its effects ranging from negative effects like Poison and Blindness to positive effects like Speed and Strength. Use it to annoy your victims or help your team turn the tides in their favor.
- Projectile
    - Applies different effects to projectiles, such as snowballs and arrows. When players are hit with the projectiles, the projectiles apply various negative effects to the victim, such as Weakness, Levitation (it's annoying!) and other random potion effects. The mutation also features various enchantment on bows, such as Flame and Punch.
- Tools
    - Gives players random enchantment on their tools. These enchantments are given with an amplifier of 3.

#### Player-based mutations

Mutations that give players different effects.

- Glow
    - Applies the glow effect and allows you to see players (teammates and enemies) through walls.
- Hardcore
    - Features a similar play style to that of the Hardcore mode in vanilla. Throughout this mutation, no natural regeneration can occur. Regenerations from kill kits and woolroom items however, are allowed. It is usually used in conjunction with the Blitz mutation.
- Jump
    - Applies greater velocities to the player, thus allowing features such as double jumps, which are otherwise not possible in normal versions of the map.
- NoFall
    - Disables fall damage.
- Stealth
    - Permanent invisibility (similar to Ghost Squadron). Stealth mode activate!

#### Targetable mutations

This mutation lists mutations which victimizes players.

- Apocalypse
    - Turns time to night and makes hostile mobs spawn uncontrollably. From Ghasts to Creepers, to Zombies, hordes of enemies will be thrown your way.
- Bomber
    - "Rocket barrage incoming!" Features dropping TNT, and reigning (and raining) terror on the players. Run and hide while you can!
- Lightning
    - Lightning is randomly summoned and smites a player. The lower health you have, the higher chance you have of getting hit. 

#### Other mutations

This mutation lists uncategorized mutations.

- Blitz
    - Limited lives assigned per player, typically between 1 to 3. Occasionally (25% chance), it may also limit lives per team (usually until all players in the team died, thus giving 1 life per player).
- Rage
    - One hit kills with a predefined kit, usually a sword and a bow. A player dies instantly when hit by these weapons.
