The developer rank is given to those who officially develop the Stratus Network, be it on the website, or for the [PGM](pgm) fork.

#### Description

Developers work on expanding the server by creating unique features for PGM, or building up the website for optimal use. Stratus Network contains many features unique to it, thanks to the hard work an dedication to the developer team. Each dev works on their own projects, however, they all come together when working on large projects. You can review the revisions [here](/stratus.network/revisions/plugins).

#### Requirements

An important requirement is to know programming and/or markup languages. Users have to apply for the role as a developer. It is a prerequisite to be familiar with Git and Maven before applying. Understanding the PGM codebase is a key when applying. When applying, one must write an application as if they were applying for a job.
