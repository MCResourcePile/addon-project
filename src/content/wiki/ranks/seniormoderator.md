Senior Moderators work together with Junior Moderators and Moderators to enforce the rules and maintain a friendly atmosphere. They represent the order of the community, are expected to uphold the rules and assist players. Senior Moderators are also responsible for the entire Moderation Staff.

#### Description

They are also responsible for the choosing and training of [Junior Moderators](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/addon-project/wiki/ranks/juniormoderator). 

#### Requirements

Moderators who have proven themselves to be valuable assets can be chosen by Admins and pre-existing Senior Moderators to become a Senior Moderator.
